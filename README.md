- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dman42076
- 👀 I’m interested in .. Learning as much as I can in as many areas as I can  I pride myself on being as diverse as possible.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code. I have gone through HTML and am in the process of learning CSS. I'm working on it daily and hope to be of some use with it soon. I've also done some JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that's good for beginners. I'm a fast learner and I have the ability to pay attention to detail. I will very much appreciate learning from someone who is willing to offer their time and attention to teaching me.
- 📫 How to reach me: feel free to send me an email @ dman38242@gmail.com
